A personal assistant programmed in Python made by me - Roland, a 10 year old.
This .py file only uses the following arguments:
if:
else:
print("")
pass
input("")
It is a very simple personal assistant programmed in python, just like i said up top.
Normally recieves daily updates.
The version number will only be raised when one day has passed.
There is not much to talk about here.
Stay tuned for v0.0.2 10.02.2023!
