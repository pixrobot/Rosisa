A personal assistant programmed in Python made by me - Roland, a 10 year old.
This .py file only uses the following arguments:
if:
else:
print("")
pass
input("")
It is a very simple personal assistant programmed in python, just like i said up top.
Normally recieves daily updates.
The version number will only be raised when one day has passed.
