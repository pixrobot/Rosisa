The release tag system works in the following order (as of 10.02.2023)
public_betas = since it has no version number it indicates the first public beta
public_beta_vX.X.X = indicates that the version of Rosisa is a public beta
public_beta_previews = since it has no version number it indicates the first public beta preview
public_beta_preview_vX.X.X = indicates that the version of Rosisa is a public beta preview

<----[What is a public beta preview?]---->
A public beta preview is a preview of the future release of public beta. Hence it is a developer beta uploaded to the public.
public_beta_preview_vX.X.X = indicates that the version of Rosisa is a public beta preview

<----[Why does the public_betas tag indicate that it contains multiple because it is in plural?]---->
It is because since it is my first time running a repository, i didnt know that you couldnt have multiple versions under one tag.
